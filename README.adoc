# Go with Dep preinstalled

Base image is `golang:1.10.3-stretch` and `dep v0.5.0` is installed into `$GOPATH/bin`,
so `dep` command is available in `$PATH`.

## Example usage

Say you've got a program called `foo`.  In your `Dockerfile`:

    FROM vmj0/golang-dep:1.10.3-stretch-0.5.0 as build
    # Build a static binary
    WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/user/foo
    COPY Gopkg.* *.go ./
    RUN dep ensure && CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -a -o foo
    # Build a minimal container image
    FROM sratch
    COPY --from=build /go/src/github.com/user/foo/foo /
    CMD ["/foo"]
